# Capstone_Project_Peraturanku 

Readme untuk di Github:
Peraturanku is a mobile application that has information about UUD 1945, Undang-Undang, PP, Perpres, and Perda. We want to make this application because as mentioned before there is only a little information about UUD and the other rules in Indonesia. We want to provide the citizens of Indonesia this application so they have knowledge about some new rules or maybe the rules that already exist or not used anymore.

Because there is no integration between frontend, backend, and machine learning now. So we divide this application into 2 parts. The first part is the Android application developed by Mobile Development Team and Cloud Computing team. In this part, you can see a list of existing laws, information about it, and download links.
For the Android Application, you can run it by: 
> Get the code from 'src_code' branch. 

> Put the code to your Android Studio project directory.

> Open and run it with Android Studio.

Nb: For now, the frontend code and the backend code are able to combine although it's still not perfect in some aspect or feature (example: when clicking another menu, the homepage will be shown and cover the supposed UI for the page).


For the chatbot, you can run it by:
> Get the code from 'chatbot' directory on 'main' branch.

> You need to have the prerequisite; in CMD you need to install tensorflow, nltk, tensorflow.keras, python 3, also you need to have visual studio code (recommended),
or maybe use google colab.

> Then open the chatbot.py using the visual studio code or google colab and start using the bot, the bot can reply to your greetings, saying thank you, etc.. The bot don't need to be trained again because it had been trained.
