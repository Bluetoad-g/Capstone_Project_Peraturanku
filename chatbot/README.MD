There are two ways to run a chatbot:
1. Using CMD
- First, you need to have the prerequisites; in CMD you have to install python 3, TensorFlow, nltk, tensorflow.keras and to open it can use Visual Studio Code (recommended)
- Then open chatbot.py using CMD to start using the bot. The bot can reply to your greetings, saying thank you, answer your question, etc.  The bot don't need to be trained again because it had been trained. But if you want to see the results of the training data, you can open train.py in CMD.

2. Using Google Collaboratory
- First, open Google Collaboratory in your browser.
- Then, upload the notebook file Chatbot_Peraturanku.ipynb.
- Once open, before running it in Google Collaboratory you can enter the intents.json file manually or you can import it via your Google Drive by adjusting the location of the existing intents.json file.
